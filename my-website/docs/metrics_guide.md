## Metrics explained 

### Client model
The new release of audEERING’s call centre **client model** now detects _very negative_, _negative_,
_neutral_, and _positive_ tone of voice of the client - but what does these metrics mean? And how does the Jabra Voice Analytics app listen to _how_ something is said and not _what_ is said? 

#### Neutral client tone
