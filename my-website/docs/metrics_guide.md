<!-- ### Here you find explanations on the metrics used to describe the tone of the client and the agent during a call. -->

## Speech metrics 
The new release of the Jabra Voice Analytics app now contains the speech metrics, *Intonation* and *Speaking rate*. They are designed to inform the agent when their voice has fallen outside of a normal range for an agent.

| Metric | Describtion      |  
| -------- | --------- | 
| **Intonation** | Intonation relates to a speaker’s use of pitch variations as they speak. Low pitch variation in speech is perceived as monotonous or boring and would therefore fall outside the range for good use of intonation.|
| **Speaking rate**| Speaking too slowing or too fast can also be perceived negatively by the client. |
