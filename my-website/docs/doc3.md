## Metrics explained 

### Client model
The new release of audEERING’s call centre **client model** now detects _very negative_, _negative_,
_neutral_, and _positive_ tone of voice of the client - but what does these metrics mean? And how does the Jabra Voice Analytics app listen to _how_ something is said and not _what_ is said? 

#### Neutral client tone
Neutral means no clear emotion. The speaker is using their “normal” speaking voice and not
making any extra effort to convey an emotional state.

#### Very negative client tone
Very negative means the speaker sounds angry. 

#### Negative client tone
Negative means the speaker sounds dissatisfied or annoyed.

#### Positive client tone
Positive means the speaker sounds either, satisfied, happy, or friendly.

### Agent model

#### Neutral agent tone
Neutral means the agent is not making any extra effort to sound engaged or friendly.

#### Positive agent tone
Positive means the agent sounds more engaged, friendly, or happy.

#### Very positive agent tone
Very positive means the agent sounds highly engaged and very friendly.

#### Negative agent tone
Negative means the agent sounds more disinterested, bored, or annoyed.
